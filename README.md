<h2 align="center"> Network Traffic Analysis Lab </h2>
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of network traffic analysis using the open-source tools Wireshark and Snort. 
By analyzing network traffic, we will identify potential security threats, network anomalies, and performance bottlenecks.</br>

</br>This step-by-step guide will help you provide valuable hands-on experience in network traffic analysis and identify malicious traffic.

### Overview
* **Wireshark**: A powerful network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting network traffic.
* **Snort**: An open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) for detecting network-based threats.

### Prerequisites
* **Kali Linux** : This will use to analyze malicious network traffic using Wireshark
* **Preinstalled and configured Snort server** : This will use to record the alerts generated by Snort during the analysis.
* Ensure your **Snort server** and **Kali Linux** are updated.
* Make sure you have administrative access to both systems.
